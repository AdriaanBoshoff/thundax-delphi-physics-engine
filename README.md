Delphi - 2D simple physics engine
==============
TDPE provides an approximate simulation of certain simple physical systems, such as rigid body dynamics (including collision detection) and soft body dynamics. The aim of the project is to provide a **software system for simulating physical phenomena**.
--------------
Tested under Delphi 2010/XE.
